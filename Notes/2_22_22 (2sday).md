We will attempt to build an parser for the byte sequences in the unrecongized services. (in py3.)

First, we need to understand how to convert a byte to ascii. [This link explains that we can convert that very thing.](https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-convert-an-ascii-character-to-its-hexadecimal-value-in-python)

Most sources in describe some kind of `codecs` library.

[Let's look at the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html)
