## The rest of the parser

Currently, we have the parser that makes "unreadable" service version fingerprints into legible formats.

The second part is to parse the escaped hexidecimal string

Here's there proof of concept

```
hex_string = "0x616263"[2:]
#Slice string to remove leading `0x`


bytes_object = bytes.fromhex(hex_string)
#Convert to bytes object


ascii_string = bytes_object.decode("ASCII")
#Convert to ASCII representation

print(ascii_string)
```

## We will need to:
* Iterate through each line
* Delmit by the common denominator of each line (We've noticed that each of the lines have quotes around them.)
* Treat each sequence between the `\` characters as it's own "word"
* Decide if each "word" is actual hex, or if it is garbage. 
* Put all of this back together in the original format.

Pseudo Code:
```
Strip()
for each line:
cut off everything that isn't betweeen the first and last '"' character.

parse_hex()

# (last one logic) 
if there is a "\" but no "\" at the end, save that to the var and operate on it 

Take the output of Strip() and for each line, start at the first "\" and traverse until you hit the next "\".

put all of that into a variable, and convert it from text to ascii.

If the var isn't ascii: 
Just put it back where it was.
```

That is the basic logic of the hex parser. ^^
