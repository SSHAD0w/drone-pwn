## Port scanning the drone 
We used an app called "portDroid" to portscan the drone and the phone simultaniously.
 
 **We gained no new information.** All ports that we found match our nmap scans.
 
## Cleaning up the fingerprint parser

### We want the parser to go from a proof of concept, to becomming a more reliable script

We will do this by: 

* Using the `Argparse` libraryto tokenize arguments
* Dividing individual functionality into methods
* Leveraging `argparse` to accept any file (replace hardcoded file logic)
* Removing the "title" logic from the proof of concept.
* Replacing the rename logic to a specific default file naming convention, and leveraging the `argparse` library to give the user an option to rename their files.
* Making a pretty banner for fun.


## Adding new functionality to the parser

We still want to be able to read and analyze the escaped hexadecimal strings to see if we have any important information from the services we didn't recognize, So we will make a separate script to convert the hex into strings and eventually merge it into the parser as one big program.
